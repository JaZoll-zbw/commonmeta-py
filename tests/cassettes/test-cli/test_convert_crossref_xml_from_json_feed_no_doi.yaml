      this blog post I dive into the integration of TikTok as a\nmethodological tool
      for doing ethnographic research on social media\ninfluencers. TikTok has skyrocketed
      in popularity, boasting 672 million\ndownloads in 2022, making it the most downloaded
      entertainment app\nglobally (Statista). Beyond just entertainment, it has evolved
      into a\ngo-to search engine for younger generations seeking information about\nproducts,
      services, and explanations (Kalley, 2022). TikTok''s wide\nappeal stems from
      the fact that it is an algorithmic media. Its\nalgorithms smartly curate, personalise
      and serve content to those most\nlikely to be interested in.\u00a0\n\n<figure

      />\n<figcaption>Tinca Lukan</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nThe surge in TikTok''s
      popularity has sparked a vibrant collection of\nacademic literature delving
      into the intricacies of this platform. From\na research perspective, TikTok
      is mostly used as a rich source of user\ngenerated content that reflects cultural
      trends, expressions and social\ndynamics. While many researchers have examined
      TikTok and the cultures\nthat arise on the platform (for overview see Abidin
      and Kaye, 2021), my\napproach differs. I didn''t solely treat TikTok as the
      subject of\nanalysis; rather I utilised it as a methodological tool to navigate
      and\naddress the elements of ethnographic research into my study. This means\nI
      did ethnography through a platform.\n\nFirst things first. Why would a busy
      PhD student transform her leisurely\nTikTok scrolling into a legitimate part
      of her job? The answer is my\ndoctoral dissertation in which I examine the working
      conditions of\nsocial media influencers with the main research question: What
      shapes\nthe working conditions of social media influencers in Slovenia? I\nunderstand
      influencers according to the definition of Crystal Abidin\n(2016) who defined
      influencers as ordinary internet users who accumulate\na large number of followers
      through textual and visual narrations of\ntheir personal lives. This means I
      focus on influencers whose content\ncentres around their lifestyle and everyday
      life and not for example,\ninfluencers who promote political ideologies. What
      distinguishes\ninfluencers from content creators is that they monetise their
      community\nof followers through advertising, brand sponsorship, revenue sharing\nmodels,
      subscriptions and merchandise sales.\n\nIn order to get an answer to the question
      of what shapes the working\nconditions of social media influencers in Slovenia,
      I used an\nethnographic approach and utilised TikTok on various steps of the\nresearch
      process. Out of my research came 53 in-depth semi-structured\ninterviews with
      influencers, and (hopefully) soon, doctoral\ndissertation. Find me on TikTok
      under the handle\n[Tinca_Lukan](https://www.tiktok.com/@tinca_lukan). Just a
      heads up, I\nspeak in the language of my empirical setting which is Slovenia.\n\nIn
      the upcoming sections, I''ll present my journey of utilising TikTok as\nmy research
      field. I''ll share how it became a key player in achieving\ntheoretical saturation,
      unveiling my position in the field, securing\naccess to interviewees, fostering
      rapport, managing engagement, and\nobtaining validation from research participants.
      Additionally, I''ll\ndelve into how this process shifted my role from a researcher
      to an\ninfluencer and demonstrate that researchers can leverage the platform\nnot
      just as a source of data but also as a tool for scientific\nengagement and channel
      of communication with the broader audience.\u00a0\n\n## TikTok as a field\n\nIn
      ethnography, the term \"field\" refers to the specific social or\ncultural setting
      where an ethnographer conducts their research. The\nfield is an environment
      or community that the ethnographer immerses\nthemselves in to study social dynamics,
      behaviours, and cultural\npractices of the people within that setting (O''Reilly,
      2012). In a\ntraditional sense, the field most often denotes a geographically
      bounded\nlocation, \"imagine yourself suddenly set down surrounded by all your\ngear,
      alone on a tropical beach close to native village\" (Malinowski,\n1922: 4).\u00a0\n\nWhile
      conducting research on influencers'' working conditions, my\ninvestigation didn''t
      lead me to a tropical beach but rather to the\nalgorithmic realm of the social
      media platform TikTok. While I also\nfocused on influencers present on Instagram
      and YouTube, I started with\nTikTok because of its excellent recommendation
      algorithm. As with any\nother social media platform, what TikTok chooses to
      show is based on how\nwe use the app, but the main difference is, as MIT Technology
      Review put\nit, \"TikTok is simply better at it\" (Ohlheiser, 2021). As influencers\nare
      platform-native workers (Poell et al., 2021), it becomes useful to\nconsider
      social media platforms as one of our fields of research. By\ndesignating TikTok
      as my research field, the initial entry was\nstraightforward, devoid of gatekeepers,
      as creating a TikTok account is\na seamless process. With the account set up,
      the subsequent step was\nidentifying potential research participants. TikTok''s
      algorithm,\ndesigned to provide content aligned with perceived user interests,\nplayed
      a pivotal role in achieving the next step of ethnographic\nresearch, which pertains
      to saturation.\n\n## TikTok for achieving saturation\n\nSaturation refers to
      the point in a research study when the collection\nof new data ceases to provide
      additional insights or generate new\ninformation (O''Reilly, 2012). It also
      pertains to the concept of\ntheoretical sampling, which involves explicitly
      seeking out people and\ncases relevant to the specific angle or topic under
      focus. Angele\nChristin (2020) argues that we can employ algorithms to assist
      with\ntheoretical sampling. I utilised the algorithmic systems underpinning\nTikTok
      to identify potential research participants.\n\nIn this context, TikTok For
      You Page (FYP) became crucial as it was the\nplatform where I sought individuals
      engaged in content creation and\nmonetizing this activity through brand collaborations.
      FYP is a central\nfeature of TikTok wherein the algorithm curates a personalized
      feed for\neach user. The videos on this page are not solely based on a user''s\nexisting
      network but also encompass content predicted by the algorithm\nto be of potential
      interest. This feature proved particularly useful for\nmy research as I aimed
      to discover unknown influencers who might appear\non my FYP.\n\nUtilising the
      TikTok algorithm to assist in identifying potential\nresearch participants,
      that is, internet users who share their personal\nlives on social media and
      monetise it through various business ventures,\nintroduced specific challenges
      to my study. While seeking individuals\nfor interviews, I encountered a recurrent
      pattern of recommendations,\npresenting influencers aligned with my personal
      interests. I\nconsistently received content from female influencers in their
      late 20s\nwho promoted a healthy lifestyle and wholesome food preparations.
      I\nfound myself in what Pariser (2011) termed a \"filter bubble.\" This\nconcept
      describes the personalised and selective information ecosystems\nshaped by online
      platforms and algorithms. It arises when algorithms\npredict and selectively
      present information based on assumptions about a\nuser''s preferences. The filter
      bubble, in this case featuring female\ninfluencers promoting a healthy lifestyle,
      shed light on and allowed me\nto explore another crucial aspect of ethnographic
      research ---\npositionality in the field.\n\n## TikTok for revealing positionality\n\nReflexivity
      urges researchers to recognize their positionality in the\nfield and the inherent
      situatedness of knowledge. This is because\nethnographers'' access to the field
      is mediated by their\nsocio-demographic characteristics, such as gender, age,
      class, and race\n(Hammersley and Atkinson, 2007). Positionality encompasses
      the\nacknowledgment that the researchers'' background, identity, experiences,\nand
      perspectives can influence the research process, including the way\ndata is
      collected, interpreted, and presented.\n\nWhile searching for influencers through
      TikTok, the algorithmic\nrecommendations revealed my positionality in the field
      and mirrored back\nmy identity and personal interests. The filter bubble, dominated
      by\nlifestyle female influencers shed light on my position in the field as a\ncisgender,
      white woman of the late millennial generation, allowing me to\nencounter my
      \"algorithmic self\" (Bishop and Kant, 2023). This encounter\nprompted me to
      reflect on biases and assumptions, and my role in the\nresearch process. My
      identity markers might explain that the most\ninsightful interviews stemmed
      from influencers who shared similarities\nwith me, fostering a same-gender and
      generational relationship between\nme and the interviewees.\n\nTo escape the
      \"filter bubble\" dominated by female influencers, I\nintentionally manipulated
      the algorithm by altering my TikTok content\nconsumption habits. I achieved
      this by following accounts and engaging\nwith posts by male influencers. Consequently,
      I trained and effectively\n\"tricked\" the algorithm into recommending male
      influencers across a\nvariety of content genres. The subsequent challenge involved
      conducting\ninterviews for the purpose of getting insights into their working\nconditions.\n\n##
      TikTok to gain access to research participants\n\nIn ethnography, access refers
      to the researcher''s ability to enter and\nestablish connections with the community
      or setting being studied. It\ninvolves gaining permission, trust, and acceptance
      from the individuals\nor groups in the field to observe, participate, and collect
      data\n(Neuman, 2003). In my case, access pertains to getting influencers to\nagree
      to talk to me and participate in my research. This was challenging\nas they
      were unresponsive to my requests for interviews. To secure\naccess, I utilised
      TikTok again. I started creating videos where I\ndiscussed and essentially \"advertised\"
      my research on influencers,\nintroducing myself and expressing my interest in
      conducting interviews\nwith them. I included one of these videos about my research
      in the\nrecruitment emails sent to influencers, enabling them to see me in a\nfamiliar
      format to them.\u00a0\n\nBefore extending our roles as researchers into the
      influencer culture,\nwe should be mindful of ethical standards as well as the
      impact of our\nengagement on TikTok on the research object. Concerning ethics,
      it is\ncrucial but challenging to find balance with creating engaging content\nand
      maintaining the accuracy and credibility of research findings,\nbecause platforms''
      logics could quickly nudge us into creating clickbait\ncontent. There is also
      a challenge of ensuring privacy and anonymity of\nresearch participants. The
      latter became a challenge as will be\ndiscussed in the next section. It is also
      worth noting that researchers\nhave to be prepared to engage with the audience,
      which may include\nanswering questions, comments and often also receiving criticism
      and\nhate.\u00a0\n\nBecoming a content creator myself and promoting my research
      this way\nmeans that the level of involvement of me as a researcher in the field\nchanged
      from being a full observer to becoming an observer as a\nparticipant as I also
      became a content creator on TikTok. By becoming an\ninfluencer myself, I succeeded
      in generating significant interest in my\nresearch among influencers, creating
      an appealing experience for them.\n\nIn addition, I produced different kinds
      of videos. Given that\nethnographic fieldwork involves conducting interviews,
      I adapted\ninterview questions to fit the TikTok environment. I created videos
      in\nwhich I presented a single interview question, such as asking about\ntheir
      work hours and work location. In these videos, I followed the\nethnographic
      recommendation of acting as an \"acceptable incompetent,\"\ntrying to appear
      as a friendly outsider who wants to learn more about\nthe way of life of the
      studied community (O''Reilly, 2012). In the\ncomments, influencers responded,
      for example, that they mostly work from\nhome and that influencer hubs in malls
      are not relevant to their labour.\nI followed up with individuals who commented
      on my videos by asking them\nin a reply comment if they would be interested
      in participating in an\ninterview.\n\n## TikTok for building rapport\n\nIn ethnography,
      rapport is the ability to connect with others in a way\nthat creates a climate
      of trust and understanding (Glesne, 1989).\nRapport refers to the quality of
      the relationship and understanding\nbetween the researcher and the members of
      the community being studied. A\npositive rapport enables the researcher to gain
      access to information,\nobserve more authentically, and establish a deeper understanding
      of the\nculture and social dynamics within the community. For building rapport\nsocial
      skills and personal charm of the researcher are needed and\nresearchers need
      to show real interest in their interlocutors, sincerity\nand share emotions
      (Condon et al., 2019).\n\nI utilised TikTok to tackle the challenge of building
      rapport. I created\nvideos showcasing my passion for research, offering a behind-the-scenes\nof
      what it looks like to work as a researcher. I documented my travels\nto interviews,
      displayed the setup, equipment used, and portrayed the\ndaily aspects of my
      job. I was able to bring my research participants\ninsights into \"science in
      the making\" (Shapin, 1992). Regularly sharing\ncontent led to increased recognition
      of my face. This, in turn, had an\nimpact on marketing conferences, where my
      fieldwork also took place, as\ninfluencers began approaching me and inquiring
      about my research. The\ninsight they gained into my content and daily life created
      a sense of\nfamiliarity before our actual interviews, enabling them to speak
      more\nfreely. During the interviews, I wasn''t a stranger to them.\n\nThis also
      presented a unique challenge for me as a researcher. As my\nresearch gained
      interest, some influencers expressed a desire to be\nfeatured in my TikTok content,
      eliminating the possibility of\nmaintaining their anonymity. I included them
      in my content as a way of\nexpressing gratitude for their interviews, which
      also helped alleviate\nthe feelings of researcher guilt.I incorporated influencers
      into my\ncontent by creating \"spend a day with me\" videos, documenting my
      day as\na researcher. In one segment, I featured an influencer sitting in a
      cafe\nand waving at me at the end of the interview.\u00a0\n\n## (Dis)engagement\n\nIn
      ethnography, disengagement refers to the process of withdrawing or\nending the
      researcher''s involvement in the field or with the community\nunder study. Disengagement
      requires ethical handling as it involves\nconcluding the researcher''s presence
      in the community and potentially\nceasing interactions with participants. We
      know about feelings of\nalienation and guilt towards informats on the part of
      researchers and\nhow disengagement from the field often feels as a form of betrayal
      and\nleaving behind the people that helped and informed the research as\n\"friendships
      are made and perhaps ended, perhaps retained\" (Adler and\nAdler, 2007).\n\nIn
      my case, as already recognized by Christin and Lewis (2021),\nincorporating
      social media platforms as a component of the research\nentails a fundamental
      absence of disengagement from the field. Through\nTikTok, algorithmic connections
      between me and my informants persist\neven after the fieldwork is completed.
      I stay connected and continue to\ninteract with my research participants by
      liking and commenting on their\nposts from my TikTok profile. In the case of
      social media, disengagement\nfrom the field would be quite harsh, such as unfollowing
      or blocking\nthem. It is worth noting that staying in touch with my research\nparticipants
      through TikTok helped me overcome feelings of betrayal and\nalienation after
      my fieldwork was completed.\u00a0\n\n## TikTok for participants'' validation\n\nEthnographic
      research strives to achieve validity, concordance of the\nworld as seen by the
      participants with the world as interpreted by the\nresearcher. It often involves
      member validation whereby members of the\nstudied community evaluate suitability
      of the results. This means\nsharing the research findings with research participants
      to verify the\naccuracy of the interpretations. Participants are given the opportunity\nto
      provide feedback, corrections, or additional insights to ensure that\ntheir
      perspectives are accurately represented (Neuman, 2003).\n\nTo seek validation,
      I utilised TikTok. I created five videos where I\npresented my research findings
      and interpretations and in the end asked\ninfluencers whether they agree with
      my findings. In the comments, I\noften received comments that they know very
      well what I am talking about\nand thus obtained their validation. It''s important
      to acknowledge that\nseeking validation from influencers commenting on my videos
      may\nintroduce a confirmation bias. The comments validating my research\nfindings,
      could potentially reflect a bias rather than genuine\nconfirmation. This is
      due to two main factors: firstly, the\nself-selection of individuals who choose
      to comment on these posts, with\nonly around 10 out of 53 interviewees engaging
      in this way. Secondly,\nthere is a possibility that these validating comments
      are influenced by\nsocial desirability bias -- the tendency for individuals
      to respond in a\nmanner that is perceived favourably by the researcher. Therefore,
      these\ncomments primarily serve as personal feedback for me and should not be\nregarded
      as scientific validation of my results in the context of my\ndoctoral thesis.\n\nTikTok
      videos discussing my research findings serve another purpose in\nthe research
      process: science communication. Sharing information about\nmy research beyond
      the academic sphere is beneficial. I received 12,000\nviews on my videos about
      my research findings, and while it may not be\nconsidered viral fame, when considering
      that a PhD student, if\nfortunate, may have their supervisor read their dissertation,
      achieving\nthis number of views is noteworthy. Additionally, I will soon provide\nfurther
      insights on utilising short-form videos for science\ncommunication on the HIIG
      website as an open educational resource. Stay\ntuned for more details.\n\n##
      Conclusion: Fieldwork as a personal transformation of the researcher\n\nFieldwork
      necessitates researchers'' complete immersion in a specific\nculture, and this
      immersive experience can potentially bring about\ntransformations in researchers,
      influencing their values and emotions.\nIn my case, engaging in fieldwork went
      beyond conventional expectations,\nleading to a transformation in my professional
      role. Utilising TikTok as\na methodological tool, I not only assumed the role
      of a researcher but\nalso embraced the identity of an influencer. This dual
      role was\nparticularly valuable as it allowed me to understand the processes
      of\ncontent creation, idea generation, and the challenges of navigating\nalgorithms
      for visibility. By immersing myself in the influencer role, I\ngained insights
      into their cultural references, dramas, and feuds,\nenabling me to participate
      more fully in these conversations.\n\nThe transition into an influencer role
      has altered my professional\nidentity, a phenomenon Sophie Bishop (2023) refers
      to as \"influencer\ncreep.\" This concept underscores how influencer cultures
      are permeating\nand influencing practices across various professions. Influencer
      creep\ninvolves the adoption of self-branding, optimization, and authenticity,\nand
      as a researcher, I have drawn from these influencer techniques. The\nincorporation
      of TikTok as a methodological tool serves as a tangible\nexample of how influencer
      culture norms have transcended their original\ndomain, infiltrating the landscape
      of academic research. This\nintegration blurs the boundaries between traditional
      academic roles and\nthe evolving social media-influencer labour. There are many
      pitfalls of\ninfluencer culture creeping into the academic profession, like
      requiring\nself-promotion and experiencing hate and hostility on social media.
      For\nexample, one commenter of my video dismissed the relevance of\nresearching
      influencers, likening it to a \"second-grade middle school\nessay\". Despite
      these challenges, I would employ this methodology again.\nIt has helped me to
      engage better with my research participants because\nI genuinely experienced
      what it means to seek visibility on social\nmedia. It has also improved my ability
      to communicate my research in an\naccessible and understandable manner. My TikTok
      also helped me\nlegitimise the research topic of social media influencers as
      due to my\ncontent on TikTok mainstream media in Slovenia became interested
      in the\ntopic of social media influencers and they regularly contact me to\ncomment
      on this topic which helped me to popularise this topic and make\nit legitimate
      as influencing is career aspiration of many young people\nand presents the present
      and future of work.\n","doi":null,"guid":"https://elephantinthelab.org/?p=4540","id":"a8a84260-1f16-444c-8e70-2cb6702611a0","image":"https://elephantinthelab.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/pexels-photo-6954220-scaled.jpeg","indexed_at":0,"language":"en","published_at":1702980397,"reference":[],"relationships":[],"summary":"<strong>\n
