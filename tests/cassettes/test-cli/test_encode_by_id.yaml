      of the [Markdown for\nScience](https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki) workshop
      that took\nplace in June 2013 was a decision on a name - *Scholarly Markdown*
      - and\na brief\n[definition](https://github.com/scholmd/scholmd/wiki/What-is-Markdown):\n\n1.  Markdown
      that supports the requirements of scientific texts\n2.  Markdown as format that
      glues open scientific text resources\n    together\n3.  A reference implementation
      with documentation and tests\n4.  A community\n\nIn my eyes this is still a
      great definition. And this week something\nimportant happened that is very relevant
      for Scholarly Markdown. A small\ngroup of people deeply involved in Markdown
      announced [Standard\nMarkdown](http://commonmark.org/):\n\n> We propose a standard,
      unambiguous syntax specification for Markdown,\n> along with a suite of comprehensive
      tests to validate Markdown\n> implementations against this specification. We
      believe this is\n> necessary, even essential, for the future of Markdown.\n\nMarkdown
      is in widespread use, but a lack of standard syntax and set of\ncomprehensive
      tests has hindered the adoption for more complex use\ncases, the development
      of cross-platform tools, and the use of markdown\nas a document interchange
      format. I am therefore 100% behind this\ninitiative. In particular since this
      is not just an initiative by large\ncommercial organizations heavily using Markdown
      such as Stack Exchange,\nGithub or Reddit, but that the entire spec and both
      reference\nimplementations have been written by [John\nMacFarlane](http://johnmacfarlane.net/),
      the author of Pandoc, the\nuniversal document converter. Not only does Pandoc
      already support many\nof the features required by Scholarly Markdown (e.g. math
      and\ncitations), but John is the Chair of the Department of Philosophy at UC\nBerkeley.\n\nMarkdown
      was developed in 2004 by John Gruber, and he [holds the\nrights](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/license)
      to the name\nMarkdown. He didn''t want this initiative to use the name ****Standard\nMarkdown****,
      so the implementation was\n[renamed](http://blog.codinghorror.com/standard-markdown-is-now-common-markdown/)\nto
      [CommonMark](http://commonmark.org/).\n\nThe consequences of all this for Scholarly
      Markdown?\n\n- CommonMark focusses on the basic features of the language, but
      once\n  the specification is agreed upon and implemented by a critical mass
      of\n  tools, it is clear that there needs to be a standardized way to handle\n  extensions
      of the language. This is both about features used by lots\n  of people such
      as tables, but also functionality relevant only for\n  scholarly content.\n-
      This brings us one gigantic step closer to a reference implementation\n  and
      set of tests for Scholarly Markdown, as hopefully Scholarly\n  Markdown can
      build upon the work by John and the CommonMark team.\n- The name Scholarly Markdown
      might not be a good idea going forward. We\n  should either change the name
      to align with CommonMark, or we should\n  come up with a totally different name,
      something that the\n  screenwriters have done with [their](http://fountain.io/)\n  implementation
      of Markdown.\n","doi":"https://doi.org/10.53731/r294649-6f79289-8cw06","guid":"62d42bbd41e317003df48d61","id":"d0ca6fa3-3a93-46d3-b820-446938d78f70","image":"https://blog.front-matter.io/content/images/2023/09/typewriter.png","indexed_at":1705647986,"language":"en","published_at":1410102600,"reference":[],"relationships":[],"summary":"One
