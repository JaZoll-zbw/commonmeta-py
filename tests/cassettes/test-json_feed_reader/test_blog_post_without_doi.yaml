      publications into research topics or research areas\nis crucial for many bibliometric
      analyses. While there are lots of\napproaches for classifying publications,
      most of these approaches lack\ntransparency. Although there are exceptions (see\n[here](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-00749-y){target=\"_blank\"}
      and\n[here](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/make-maps-of-research-interactive-detailed-and-open){target=\"_blank\"}),\nthese
      approaches are typically based on data from proprietary sources or\nthey rely
      on non-transparent algorithms.\n\nWe introduce an open approach to the algorithmic
      classification of\nresearch publications. This approach builds on a [methodology
      we\ndeveloped more than a decade\nago](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.0532v1){target=\"_blank\"}.
      While this\nmethodology was originally applied to closed data from proprietary\nsources,
      we now apply it to open data from\n[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/){target=\"_blank\"}.
      We make available a\nfully open classification of publications. The research
      areas in this\nclassification are labeled using a new labeling approach, and
      the\nclassification is presented visually using the [VOSviewer Online\nsoftware](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWe
      also release open source software that enables anyone to reproduce\nand extend
      our work.  \n\n### Building the classification\n\nWe built [our\nclassification](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276){target=\"_blank\"}\nbased
      on OpenAlex data, using the\n[snapshot](https://docs.openalex.org/download-all-data/openalex-snapshot){target=\"_blank\"}\nreleased
      on November 21, 2023. Over the past years, our methodology has\nbeen used to
      create classifications based on Web of Science and Scopus\ndata. These classifications
      are available in\n[InCites](https://clarivate.com/blog/introducing-citation-topics/){target=\"_blank\"}\nand\n[SciVal](https://www.elsevier.com/products/scival/overview/topic-prominence){target=\"_blank\"},\nrespectively.
      Compared to Web of Science and Scopus, OpenAlex has the\nbenefit that its data
      is fully open and that it offers a broader\ncoverage of the scholarly literature.\n\nTo
      build our classification, we used the so-called [extended direct\ncitation approach](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00035){target=\"_blank\"}\nin
      combination with the [Leiden\nalgorithm](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-41695-z){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      source code of the software we used is available\n[here](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassification){target=\"_blank\"}.\nOur
      classification covers the 71 million journal articles, proceedings\npapers,
      preprints, and book chapters in OpenAlex that were published\nbetween 2000 and
      2023 and that are connected to each other by citation\nlinks. Based on 1715
      million citation links, we built a three-level\nhierarchical classification.
      Each publication was assigned to a research\narea at each of the three levels
      of the classification. Research areas\nconsist of publications that are relatively
      strongly connected by\ncitation links and that can therefore be expected to
      be topically\nrelated. At each level of the classification, a publication was
      assigned\nto only one research area, which means research areas do not overlap.\n\nUsing
      the parameter values reported in Table 1, we obtained a\nclassification that
      consists of 4521 research areas at the lowest (most\ngranular) level, 917 research
      areas at the middle level, and 20 research\nareas at the highest (least granular)
      level. We also algorithmically\nlinked each research area in our classification
      to one or more of the\nfollowing five broad main fields: biomedical and health
      sciences, life\nand earth sciences, mathematics and computer science, physical
      sciences\nand engineering, and social sciences and humanities.\n\n|                        |         |\n|:----------------------:|:-------:|\n|       Parameter        |  Value  |\n|

      1. Parameter values used to build the classification. ]{.caption}\n\nGiven the
      huge size of the citation network based on which we built the\nclassification,
      the process of building the classification was\ncomputationally demanding. We
      used a computer with 200 GB internal\nmemory. The process took about 70 hours
      on this computer.\n\nLabeling the research areas in an algorithmically built
      publication\nclassification is a challenging problem. The labeling approach\nintroduced
      in our original methodology yields a list of five\ncharacteristic terms for
      each research area. While these terms usually\ngive a reasonably good impression
      of the topics covered by a research\narea, our experience is that users often
      want to have a single term that\nsummarizes what a research area is about.\n\nLarge
      language models (LLMs) offer important new opportunities to label\nresearch
      areas. We therefore used the [Updated GPT 3.5 Turbo\nLLM](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5){target=\"_blank\"},\ndeveloped
      by OpenAI, to label the 4521 research areas at the lowest\nlevel in our classification.
      The source code of our software can be\nfound\n[here](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassificationlabeling){target=\"_blank\"}.\n\nFor
      each research area, we provided the LLM with the titles of the 250\nmost cited
      publications in the area, along with the prompt shown in\nBox 1. Using this
      prompt, we asked the LLM to return a label for each\nresearch area, both a short
      one (max. three words) and a longer one\n(max. eight words). We also requested
      the LLM to provide a few sentences\nthat summarize what the research area is
      about.\n\n::: {style=\"padding:10px; background-color:#F5F5F5;\"}\nYou will
      be provided with the titles of a representative sample of\npapers from a larger
      cluster of related scientific papers.\n\nYour task is to identify the topic
      of the entire cluster based on the\ntitles of the representative papers.\n\nOutput
      the following items (in English) that describe the topic of the\ncluster: \\''short
      label\\'' (at most 3 words and format in Title Case),\n\\''long label\\'' (at
      most 8 words and format in Title Case), list of 10\n\\''keywords\\'' (ordered
      by relevance and format in Title Case),\n\\''summary\\'' (few sentences), and
      \\''wikipedia page\\'' (URL).  \nDo not start short and long labels with the
      word \\\"The\\\".  \nStart each summary with \\\"This cluster of papers\\\".  \nFormat
      the output in JSON.\n:::\n\n[Box 1. Prompt provided to the LLM. ]{.caption}\n\nTable
      2 presents the results provided by the LLM for one of the 4521\nresearch areas.
      The results show that this research area is about\nbibliometrics. Although we
      did not perform a systematic evaluation of\nthe quality of the LLM results,
      our impression is that the results are a\nsubstantial improvement over the results
      obtained using our original\nmethodology, or variants of that methodology. We
      also tried to use the\nLLM to label the research areas at the middle level and
      the highest\nlevel in our classification, but this did not yield satisfactory\nresults.\n\n|             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|

      Summary     | This cluster of papers focuses on bibliometric analysis, research
      evaluation, and the assessment of scientific impact. It covers topics such as
      citation networks, collaboration patterns, open access publishing, social impact
      assessment, altmetrics, co-authorship networks, and interdisciplinary research

      2. Output provided by the LLM for a selected research area.\n]{.caption}\n\nWhile
      the LLM results are promising, we stress that the use of LLMs such\nas GPT 3.5
      raises complex legal and ethical questions that require\nfurther consideration.
      Also, the use of GPT 3.5 requires a payment. We\npaid slightly less than USD
      50 to label 4521 research areas. We also\nconsidered the use of GPT 4, but this
      LLM is more expensive and did not\nseem to yield better results.\n\n### Visualizing
      the classification\n\nA powerful way to use our publication classification is
      to create\ninteractive landscapes of science. Figure 1 presents an example of
      such\na landscape. It was created using the [VOSviewer Online\nsoftware](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/vosviewer-goes-online-part-1).\nWe
      used the software to visualize the 4521 research areas at the lowest\nlevel
      in our classification. Each bubble represents a research area. The\nlarger the
      bubble, the larger the number of publications in the research\narea. The distance
      between bubbles approximately indicates the\nrelatedness of research areas in
      terms of citation links. In general,\nthe smaller the distance between two bubbles,
      the stronger the citation\nlinks between the two research areas. The color of
      a bubble shows the\nprimary main field to which a research area belongs. For
      instance,\nresearch areas in the physical sciences and engineering (blue) are\nlocated
      on the left side of the landscape, while research areas in the\nsocial sciences
      and humanities (red) are located on the right side.\nFinally, for some bubbles,
      the landscape also shows the label obtained\nusing our LLM-based labeling approach.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_1.png\"\nstyle=\"opacity:

      the 4521 research areas at the\nlowest level in the classification. Colors show
      the primary main field\nto which a research area belongs. ([interactive\nversion](http://tinyurl.com/ytb688e5){target=\"_blank\"})]{.caption\ndir=\"ltr\"}\n\nThe
      landscape of science presented in Figure 1 can be explored in more\ndetail in
      [this interactive\nwebtool](http://tinyurl.com/ytb688e5){target=\"_blank\"}.
      The webtool\nenables zooming in on specific parts of the landscape. It is also\npossible
      to see the list of publications included in each research area.\n\nTo illustrate
      the power of landscapes of science, we use our landscape\nto show the publication
      activity of our own institution, Leiden\nUniversity. The landscape presented
      in Figure 2 is identical to the one\nin Figure 1, except that the color of a
      bubble now indicates the\nproportion of publications in a research area with
      authors affiliated\nwith Leiden University. Purple bubbles represent research
      areas in which\nLeiden University has a strong publication activity. For each
      research\narea, the list of publications authored by Leiden University can be\nexplored
      in [our interactive\nwebtool](http://tinyurl.com/yqkgkt2x){target=\"_blank\"}.
      The webtool for\ninstance reveals that Leiden University has 570 publications
      in the\nperiod 2000-2023 in the research area labeled ''Bibliometric Analysis''.\nThis
      is one of the research areas in the social sciences and humanities\nin which
      Leiden University has its strongest publication activity.\n\n<figure>\n<img\nsrc=\"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_2.png\"\nstyle=\"opacity:

      Opening up bibliometrics\n\nWe have introduced an open approach for classifying
      research\npublications into research areas: Our approach relies on open data
      from\nOpenAlex, our software is open source, and our publication\nclassification
      is [openly\navailable](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10560276){target=\"_blank\"}.\nThe
      work presented in this blog post is part of an [ambitious\nagenda](https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/toward-open-research-information-introducing-the-information-openness-focal-area-at-cwts){target=\"_blank\"}\nwe
      have at CWTS to move to fully open approaches to bibliometrics, and\nto openness
      of research information and research analytics more\ngenerally.\n\nThe publication
      classification discussed in this blog post is a crucial\nbuilding block for
      the Open Edition of the [Leiden\nRanking](https://www.leidenranking.com/){target=\"_blank\"}
      that CWTS is\ngoing to release on January 30. The classification is also used
      by the\nOpenAlex team as a foundation for a [new topic classification for\nOpenAlex](https://groups.google.com/g/openalex-users/c/2yE1jie_D3s){target=\"_blank\"}.\nWe
      hope our work will help to advance the transition to open approaches\nto bibliometrics!  \n","doi":"https://doi.org/10.59350/qc0px-76778","guid":"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/articles/an-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications","id":"e2ecec16-405d-42da-8b4d-c746840398fa","image":"https://www.leidenmadtrics.nl/images/community/An-open-approach-for-classifying-research-publications_1.png","indexed_at":1707242608,"language":"en","published_at":1706108400,"reference":[],"relationships":[],"summary":"Classifying
