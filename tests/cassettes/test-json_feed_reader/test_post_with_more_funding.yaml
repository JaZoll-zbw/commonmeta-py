      are many things I like about this new DataCite/ORCID integration\ntool:\n\n-
      it makes it easier for researchers to get credit for their research\n  outputs.\n-
      it shows the value of persistent identifiers for data, publications\n  and people,
      and linking them together\n- it shows the Creative Commons licenses for DataCite
      content where this\n  info is available, facilitating reuse of content\n- it
      demonstrates the power of open source (thanks CrossRef!), open\n  collaboration,
      standard REST APIs, and lightweight programming\n  (Sinatra/Ruby) and deployment
      (Vagrant, Amazon EC2, Rackspace) tools\n- it shows that we don''t need a single
      -- often closed -- system, but\n  open services that build on top of each other
      using accepted community\n  standards. Tools using the ORCID API can immediately
      reuse the new\n  DataCite content, altmetrics provided by\n  [ImpactStory](https://impactstory.org/)
      are a good example\n\nI want to explore some of these ideas in the panel **Attribution:\nManaging
      Provenance, Ethics, and Metrics** at the combined [ORCID/Dryad\nMeeting](https://web.archive.org/web/20171029102032/http://orcid.org/orcid-outreach-meeting-symposium-and-codefest-may-2013)\nin
