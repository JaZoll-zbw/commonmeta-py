      are not only important to uniquely\nidentify a publication, dataset, or person,
      but the metadata for these\npersistent identifiers can provide unambiguous linking
      between\npersistent identifiers of the same type, e.g. journal articles citing\nother
      journal articles, or of different types, e.g. linking a researcher\nand the
      datasets they produced.\n\nWork is needed to connect existing persistent identifiers
      to each other\nin standardized ways, e.g. to the outputs associated with a particular\nresearcher,
      repository, institution or funder, for discovery and impact\nassessment. Some
      of the more complex but still important use cases can''t\nbe addressed by simply
      collecting and aggregating links between two\npersistent identifiers, including\n\n1.  Aggregate
      the citations for all versions of a dataset or software\n    source code\n2.  Aggregate
      the citations for all datasets hosted in a particular\n    repository, funded
      by a particular funder, or created by a\n    particular researcher\n3.  Aggregate
      all citations for a [research\n    object](http://www.researchobject.org/):
      a publication, the data\n    underlying the findings in the paper, and the software,
      samples, and\n    reagents used to create those datasets.\n\nTo address these
      use cases we need a more complex model to describe the\nresources that are identified
      by PIDs, and the connections between them:\na graph. In graph theory, the resources
      identified by PIDs correspond to\nthe nodes in this graph, and the connections
      between PIDs correspond to\nthe edges.\n\nUsing a graph makes it easier to describe
      these more complex use cases\nand relationships, and this approach has been
      frequently applied to\nsimilar questions in the past. FREYA builds on the expertise
      and close\ncollaboration with the [Research Graph](http://researchgraph.org/)
      team\nand adopts the outputs of the [Research Data Alliance DDRI Working\ngroup](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/data-description-registry-interoperability.html)\nto
      transform PID connections into an improved graph of research objects.\nThis
      project takes advantage of the best practices of graph modelling\nand distributed
      network analysis techniques. We call this the **PID\nGraph**.\n\n### PID Graph
      Use Cases\n\nBefore starting work on implementing the PID Graph, the FREYA partners\ncollected
      user stories from their communities relevant to the PID Graph\nwork. We used
      GitHub issues in a public repository for this activity and\nthen met in person
      in August 2018 to clarify, group and prioritize these\nuser stories. In total,
      we identified 48 user stories, described\n[here](https://github.com/datacite/freya/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22PID+Graph%22++label%3A%22user+story%22+).\nThe
      main outcomes of the August 2018 workshop were:\n\n1.  There is a significant
      number of relevant user stories that can only\n    be addressed by implementing
      a PID Graph.\n2.  While there is a diverse number of stakeholder groups and
      persistent\n    identifier types in these user stories, a number of common themes\n    and
      major use cases emerged in the workshop.\n3.  We didn''t identify any uses cases
      that require more than two\n    connections between PIDs, simplifying the required
      implementation\n    work needed.\n\nAfter identifying and describing the most
      relevant use cases, summarized\nabove, we started the implementation work for
      the FREYA PID Graph. Our\ngoal was to implement the PID Graph as standard production
      service\nrather than a research activity or pilot service, so scalability and\nmaintainability
      are of utmost importance. We learned a lot from the\nextensive experience gained
      in the [Research\nGraph](http://researchgraph.org/) initiative and decided to
      build PID\nGraph using a set of federated RESTful JSON APIs. PID Graph will
      not be\na single service but federated between FREYA PID providers, FREYA\ndisciplinary
      partners, and organizations outside of FREYA. PID Graph\nwill be provided by
      [RESTful JSON APIs](https://restfulapi.net/) that\ndescribe the resources (nodes)
      and connections (edges) in this graph.\nAll FREYA PID providers use RESTful
      JSON APIs to provide PID metadata so\nthat this approach aligns with the extensive
      existing infrastructure.\n\n### Initial PID Graph Implementation\n\nThe first
      working PID Graph implementation is provided by DataCite,\nextending the existing
      Event Data Service (Dasler & Cousijn,\n[2018](https://blog.datacite.org/introducing-the-pid-graph/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/s6d3-k860)),\na
      collaboration between Crossref and DataCite. Event Data is a service\nthat provides
      connections (here called events) between PIDs and other\nresources, with an
      initial focus on social media mentions and data\ncitations. The initial PID
      Graph work done by DataCite since the August\n2018 workshop has added these
      functionalities to [DataCite Event\nData](https://datacite.org/eventdata.html):\n\n####
      Include metadata about resources\n\nInclude not only metadata about connections
      but also metadata about the\nresources identified by PIDs. This dramatically
      simplifies the API calls\nneeded to construct a PID Graph. We do this by optionally
      including the\nmetadata for the **subj** and **obj** (the resources linked via
      the\nevent) in Event Data via an extra query parameter:\n<https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj>\n\nIncluding
      the metadata for subj and obj also enables queries based on\nresource metadata,
      e.g. query by type of content that is connected:\n<https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj&citationType=ScholarlyArticle-SoftwareSourceCode>\n\nThis
      query today returns 1,078 events connecting scholarly articles and\nsoftware,
      including 834 from journal articles referencing software via\nCrossref metadata
      and 210 from software referencing journal articles via\nDataCite metadata.\n\n####
      Include implicit relations in metadata about resources\n\nMetadata for resources
      contain a lot of information about connected\nPIDs. We can take advantage of
      this by including the information in\nDataCite Event Data, allowing queries
      that in effect connect two PIDs\nvia an intermediary resource and two connections.
      Specifically, we\ninclude these relations and associated PIDs:\n\n1.  Version,
      e.g. dataset A **isVersionOf** dataset B (using DataCite\n    **relatedIdentifier**
      metadata)\n2.  Granularity, e.g. dataset A **isPartOf** dataset B or dataset
      A\n    **isSupplementTo** article B (using DataCite **relatedIdentifier**\n    metadata)\n3.  Funding,
      e.g. dataset A **isFundedBy** funder B (using DataCite\n    **fundingReferences**
      metadata)\n4.  Author, e.g. dataset A **isAuthoredBy** author B (using DataCite\n    **nameIdentifier**
      metadata)\n\nThese connected PIDs can then act as a **proxy** in PID Graph queries,\nas
      demonstrated in this example:\n\n<https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj&doi=10.5061/dryad.k5k9074>\n\nThe
      query today returns one data citation of the dataset identified by\nthe DOI,
      and eight data files that are part of this dataset. If someone\ndecides to cite
      one of these data files instead of the dataset\n(following principle 8 Specificity
      and Verifiability of the Joint\nDeclaration of Data Citation Principles (Data
      Citation Synthesis Group,\n[2014](https://blog.datacite.org/introducing-the-pid-graph/#ref-https://doi.org/10.25490/a97f-egyk))),\nthat
      data citation would also be included in the DataCite Event Data\nresponse.\n\nSimilarly,
      the citation of a specific version of a dataset would be\nincluded if querying
      for the parent version of the dataset. Examples for\nfunding and authorship
      are given in the next paragraph.\n\n#### Include more types of events\n\nThe
      initial focus in Event Data was on social media mentions and data\ncitations.
      DataCite has added author-resource links and funder-resource\nlinks, using ORCID
      and Crossref Funder ID as PIDs, respectively.\nDataCite also include dataset
      usage statistics, as part of the work in\nthe Make Data Count (Lowenberg, Budden,
      & Cruse,\n[2018](https://blog.datacite.org/introducing-the-pid-graph/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5438/pre3-2f25))\nproject.
      This enables the following two use cases:\n\n1.  Show all datasets created by
      a particular researcher and their usage\n    stats\n    <https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj&orcid=0000-0002-1194-1055>.\n    The
      query today returns four datasets created by a researcher\n    identified via
      her ORCID ID, plus a combined 21 unique views of\n    these datasets in February
      and March 2019.\n2.  Show all datasets funded by the European Commission that
      have been\n    cited by a journal article\n    <https://api.datacite.org/events?include=subj,obj&doi=10.13039/501100000780&citation-type=Dataset-ScholarlyArticle>.\n    The
      query today returns 69 datasets cited by 37 journal articles.\n\n### Collaborating
      on Research Data Graph Initiatives\n\nThe aim is for any interested parties
      within and beyond FREYA to\nimplement PID Graph services, meaning that we have
      to figure out how\nbest to coordinate and enable this federated PID Graph. And
      of course,\nthere are initiatives outside of FREYA taking similar approaches
      and\naddressing similar use cases. These include:\n\n1.  The already mentioned
      Research Graph Foundation\n2.  [Scholix](http://www.scholix.org/): a framework
      for Scholarly Link\n    Exchange coordinated by a Research Data Alliance (RDA)
      Working Group\n3.  The OpenAIRE Research Graph (Manghi & Bardi,\n    [2019](https://blog.datacite.org/introducing-the-pid-graph/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2600275)),\n    an
      open metadata research graph of interlinked scientific products,\n    with access
      rights information, linked to funding information and\n    research communities.\n4.  Asclepias
      (Ioannidis & Gonzalez Lopez,\n    [2019](https://blog.datacite.org/introducing-the-pid-graph/#ref-https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2548643)),\n    a
      broker service initially developed to track software citations in\n    astronomy.\n\nTo
      coordinate these activities we have organized a Birds of a Feather\nsession
      at the RDA Plenary in Philadelphia next week (Wednesday at 2:30\nPM): [Research
      Data\nGraph](https://rd-alliance.org/bof-Research-Data-Graph-RDA-13th-Plenary-meeting).\n\nThe
      initial implementation of the PID Graph in DataCite Event Data\ncontains 5.38
      million events as of today and more work is needed to\nconvert existing events
      to the new format (we expect a total of 25\nmillion events with the current
      data source), improve documentation, and\nbuild visualizations and other frontend
      services to make it easier to\nshow the PID Graph information we already have.
      But if you can''t wait\nand are not afraid working with JSON REST APIs, feel
      free to explore\nDataCite Event Data, which is a free service with no registration\nrequired,
      by starting with the\n[documentation](https://support.datacite.org/docs/eventdata-guide).\n\nAnd
      please reach out to us via the [PID\nForum](https://www.pidforum.org/) if you
      are interested to learn more\nabout PID Graph, want to see your data in PID
      Graph, or are working on a\nrelated project and want to coordinate. And of course,
      join us for the\nRDA Plenary session next week in Philadelphia if you plan to
      attend the\nconference.\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nThis post has been cross-posted
