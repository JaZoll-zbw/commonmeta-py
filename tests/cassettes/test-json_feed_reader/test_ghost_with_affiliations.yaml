      al. (2013) published a paper looking at\ncurrent patterns of how datasets o
      biological databases are cited in\nresearch articles, based on an analysis of
      the full text Open Access\narticles available from Europe PMC. They identified
      data citations by:\n\n1.  Accession numbers available in articles as publisher-supplied,\n    structured
      content;\n2.  Accession numbers identified in articles by text mining;\n3.  References
      to articles from the ENA, UniProt and PDBe records.\n\nThey could show that
      text mining doubles the number of structured\nannotations available in journal
      articles (from 2.26% to 5.15%), and\nthat these structured annotations should
      be extended beyond the ENA,\nUniProt and PDB identifiers that their analysis
      focused on. ENA\nidentifiers (for nucleotide sequences in GenBank, EMBL or DDBJ)
      make up\nthe largest group, with 160,112 identifiers found in the 410,364\narticles
      that were analyzed.\n\nAnother result in the paper is that references to articles
      in these\ndatabases show little overlap with database links found in articles.
      One\nof the conclusions drawn by the author is that\n\n> Text-mining can be
      used to extend structured data citation, and could\n> be a basis for the development
      of services to help authors or editors\n> to add structured content at the beginning
      of the publication process,\n> rather than after the fact.\n\nAdding structured
      data citations during the authoring phase of a\nmanuscript requires tools that
      make this process easier, providing\nauto-linking and verification without requiring
      extra input from the\nauthor. Scholarly Markdown is an ideal platform for these
      tools, as it\nis easier to extend than traditional word processors such as Microsoft\nWord.
      During a small workshop around persistent identifiers for data\n([DataCite](http://datacite.org/)),
      people ([ORCID](http://orcid.org/))\nand geological samples ([IGSN](http://www.geosamples.org/igsnabout))\nthat
      took place yesterday and today at the [GFZ\nPotsdam](http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/portal/gfz/cegit)
      I worked on a tool\nthat does auto-linking for these identifiers:\n\n- IGSN.
      [International Geosample\n  Number](http://www.geosamples.org/igsnabout)\n-
      MGI identifiers for genetically modified mouse strains in the\n  [Internal Mouse
      Strain Resource](http://www.findmice.org/about)\n- ENA. [Genbank / ENA / DDBJ
      nucleotide\n  sequences](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/about/about)\n- UniProt protein
      sequences from the [UniProt\n  database](http://www.uniprot.org/help/about)\n-
      PDB. [Protein Data Bank protein structure\n  information](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/static.do?p=home/faq.html)\n\nThe
      list includes the IGSN, the database identifiers studied by Kafkas\net al (2013),
      and the MGI identifier for genetically altered mice. In\nthe life sciences there
      is a long tradition - and requirement by\njournals - to use database identifiers
      for data, but identifiers for\nresources such as genetically modified mice are
      unfortunately not in\ncommon use.\n\nThis blog uses the Pandoc markdown processor
      and the Jekyll static\nwebsite generator. The easiest way to implement this
      functionality was\nby writing a filter for the liquid templating engine used
      by Jekyll, and\nprovide this filter as a Jekyll plugin. The Jekyll plugin can
      be found\nat [mfenner/jekyll-scholmd](https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-scholmd).\nThe
      plugin expects the name of the identifier, followed by a colon and\noptional
      space, followed by the identifier:\n\n    GenBank:  M10090\n    IGSN:  JRH964436\n    MGI:  96922\n    UniProt:  P02144\n    PDB:  1mbn\n\nThis
      input is automatically translated into\n[GenBank:M10090](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/M10090),\n[IGSN:JRH964436](http://hdl.handle.net/10273/JRH964436),\n[MGI:96922](http://www.findmice.org/summary?gaccid/96922),
      and\ninformation about the human myoglobin protein\n([UniProt:P02144](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P02144),\n[PDB:1mbn](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1mbn))\nis
      generated in a similar fashion.\n\nThe plugin was written in a few hours today,
      and is my first Jekyll\nplugin. There is room for improvement, e.g. support
      for more\nidentifiers, better regex matching, validation of the resulting links,\nand
      automated tag generation if an identifier is found. Ideally the\nauto-linking
      should happen in the markdown and not the HTML output, so\nthat these structured
      database links are also available in other\nmarkdown outputs such as PDF. But
      this is another example how Scholarly\nMarkdown can make it easier for researchers
      to author documents without\nrequiring a fancy web-based user interface.\n\n##
