      al. (2013) published a paper looking at\ncurrent patterns of how datasets o
      biological databases are cited in\nresearch articles, based on an analysis of
      the full text Open Access\narticles available from Europe PMC. They identified
      data citations by:\n\n1.  Accession numbers available in articles as publisher-supplied,\n    structured
      content;\n2.  Accession numbers identified in articles by text mining;\n3.  References
      to articles from the ENA, UniProt and PDBe records.\n\nThey could show that
      text mining doubles the number of structured\nannotations available in journal
      articles (from 2.26% to 5.15%), and\nthat these structured annotations should
      be extended beyond the ENA,\nUniProt and PDB identifiers that their analysis
      focused on. ENA\nidentifiers (for nucleotide sequences in GenBank, EMBL or DDBJ)
      make up\nthe largest group, with 160,112 identifiers found in the 410,364\narticles
      that were analyzed.\n\nAnother result in the paper is that references to articles
      in these\ndatabases show little overlap with database links found in articles.
      One\nof the conclusions drawn by the author is that\n\n> Text-mining can be
      used to extend structured data citation, and could\n> be a basis for the development
      of services to help authors or editors\n> to add structured content at the beginning
      of the publication process,\n> rather than after the fact.\n\nAdding structured
      data citations during the authoring phase of a\nmanuscript requires tools that
      make this process easier, providing\nauto-linking and verification without requiring
      extra input from the\nauthor. Scholarly Markdown is an ideal platform for these
      tools, as it\nis easier to extend than traditional word processors such as Microsoft\nWord.
      During a small workshop around persistent identifiers for data\n([DataCite](http://datacite.org/)),
      people ([ORCID](http://orcid.org/))\nand geological samples ([IGSN](http://www.geosamples.org/igsnabout))\nthat
      took place yesterday and today at the [GFZ\nPotsdam](http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/portal/gfz/cegit)
      I worked on a tool\nthat does auto-linking for these identifiers:\n\n- IGSN.
      [International Geosample\n  Number](http://www.geosamples.org/igsnabout)\n-
      MGI identifiers for genetically modified mouse strains in the\n  [Internal Mouse
      Strain Resource](http://www.findmice.org/about)\n- ENA. [Genbank / ENA / DDBJ
      nucleotide\n  sequences](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/about/about)\n- UniProt protein
      sequences from the [UniProt\n  database](http://www.uniprot.org/help/about)\n-
      PDB. [Protein Data Bank protein structure\n  information](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/static.do?p=home/faq.html)\n\nThe
      list includes the IGSN, the database identifiers studied by Kafkas\net al (2013),
      and the MGI identifier for genetically altered mice. In\nthe life sciences there
      is a long tradition - and requirement by\njournals - to use database identifiers
      for data, but identifiers for\nresources such as genetically modified mice are
      unfortunately not in\ncommon use.\n\nThis blog uses the Pandoc markdown processor
      and the Jekyll static\nwebsite generator. The easiest way to implement this
      functionality was\nby writing a filter for the liquid templating engine used
      by Jekyll, and\nprovide this filter as a Jekyll plugin. The Jekyll plugin can
      be found\nat [mfenner/jekyll-scholmd](https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-scholmd).\nThe
      plugin expects the name of the identifier, followed by a colon and\noptional
      space, followed by the identifier:\n\n    GenBank:  M10090\n    IGSN:  JRH964436\n    MGI:  96922\n    UniProt:  P02144\n    PDB:  1mbn\n\nThis
      input is automatically translated into\n[GenBank:M10090](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/M10090),\n[IGSN:JRH964436](http://hdl.handle.net/10273/JRH964436),\n[MGI:96922](http://www.findmice.org/summary?gaccid/96922),
      and\ninformation about the human myoglobin protein\n([UniProt:P02144](http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/P02144),\n[PDB:1mbn](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1mbn))\nis
      generated in a similar fashion.\n\nThe plugin was written in a few hours today,
      and is my first Jekyll\nplugin. There is room for improvement, e.g. support
      for more\nidentifiers, better regex matching, validation of the resulting links,\nand
      automated tag generation if an identifier is found. Ideally the\nauto-linking
      should happen in the markdown and not the HTML output, so\nthat these structured
      database links are also available in other\nmarkdown outputs such as PDF. But
      this is another example how Scholarly\nMarkdown can make it easier for researchers
      to author documents without\nrequiring a fancy web-based user interface.\n\n##

      blog post later this week explaining the\nDataCite auto-update implementation.*\n\nSince
      ORCID''s inception, our key goal has been to unambiguously identify\nresearchers
      and provide tools to automate the connection between\nresearchers and their
      creative works. We are taking a big step towards\nachieving this goal today,
      with the launch of\n[Auto-Update](http://orcid.org/blog/2014/11/21/new-functionality-friday-auto-update-your-orcid-record)\nfunctionality
      in collaboration with [Crossref](http://www.crossref.org/)\nand [DataCite](https://www.datacite.org/).\n\nThere''s
      already been a lot of excitement about Auto-Update: [Crossref''s\nrecent\nannouncement](https://www.crossref.org/blog/crossref-to-auto-update-orcid-records/)\nabout
      the imminent launch generated a flurry of discussion and\ncelebration on social
      media. Our own\n[tweet](https://twitter.com/ORCID_Org/status/647020600192581633)
      on the\ntopic was viewed over 10,500 times and retweeted by 60 other accounts.\n\nSo
      why all the fuss? We think Auto-Update will transform the way\nresearchers manage
      their scholarly record. Until now, researchers have\nhad to manually maintain
      their record, connecting new activities as they\nare made public. In ORCID,
      that meant using [Search &\nLink](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006973653-Add-works-by-direct-import-from-other-systems)\ntools
      developed by our member organizations to claim works manually.\nResearchers
      frequently ask, \"Why, if I include my ORCID iD when I submit\na manuscript
      or dataset, isn''t my ORCID record \"automagically\" updated\nwhen the work
      is published?\"\n\nWith the launch of Auto-Update, that is just what will happen.\n\n**It
      might seem like magic but there are a few steps to make it work**:\n\n- **Researchers**.
      You need to do two things: (1) use your ORCID iD when\n  submitting a paper
      or dataset, and (2) authorize Crossref and DataCite\n  to update your ORCID
      record. In keeping with our commitment to\n  ensuring that researchers maintain
      full control of their ORCID record,\n  you may revoke this permission at any
      time, and may also choose\n  privacy settings for the information posted on
      your record.\n- **Publishers and data centers**. These organizations also have
      two\n  things to do: (1) collect ORCID identifiers during the submission\n  workflow,
      using a process that involves authentication (not a type-in\n  field!), and
      (2) embed the iD in the published paper and include the\n  iD when submitting
      information to Crossref or DataCite.\n- **Crossref and DataCite**. Upon receipt
      of data from a publisher or\n  data center with a valid identifier, Crossref
      or DataCite can\n  automatically push that information to the researcher''s
      ORCID record.\n  More information about how to opt out of this service can be
      found\n  here: [the ORCID\n  Inbox](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006972953).\n\n###
      Why is this so revolutionary?\n\nA bit of background, first. Crossref and DataCite,
      both non-profit\norganizations, are leaders in minting DOIs (Digital Object
      Identifiers)\nfor research publications and datasets. A\n[DOI](http://www.crossref.org/01company/16fastfacts.html#sthash.o7NGwOnP.dpuf)\nis
      a unique alphanumeric string assigned to a digital object -- in this\ncase,
      an electronic journal article, book chapter, or a dataset. Each\nDOI is associated
      with a set of basic metadata and a URL pointer to the\nfull text, so that it
      uniquely identifies the content item and provides\na persistent link to its
      location on the internet.\n\nCrossref, working with over a thousand scholarly
      publishers, has\ngenerated well over 75 million DOIs for journal articles and
      book\nchapters. DataCite works with nearly 600 data centers worldwide and has\ngenerated
      over 6.5 million DOIs to date. Between them, Crossref and\nDataCite have already
      received almost half a million works from\npublishers and data centers that
      include an ORCID iD validated by the\nauthor/contributor. With Auto-Update functionality
      in place, information\nabout these articles can transit (with the author''s
      permission) to the\nauthor''s ORCID record.\n\nAuto-Update doesn''t stop at
      a researcher''s ORCID record. Systems that\nhave integrated ORCID APIs and have
      a researcher''s ORCID record\nconnected to that system \\-- their faculty profile
      system, library\nrepository, webpage, funder reporting system \\-- can receive
      alerts from\nORCID. Information can move easily and unambiguously across systems.\n\nThis
      is the beginning of the end for the endless rekeying of information\nthat plagues
      researchers \\-- and anyone involved in research reporting.\nSurely something
      to celebrate!\n\n**Questions you may have**:\n\n#### Q. What do I need to do
      to sign up for auto-update?\n\nYou need to grant permission to Crossref and
      DataCite to post\ninformation to your ORCID record. You can do this today by
      using the\nSearch and Link wizard for DataCite available through the ORCID Registry\nor
      the [DataCite Search](https://search.datacite.org/) page. We also\nhave added
      a new ORCID Inbox, so that you can receive a message from\nCrossref or DataCite
      if they receive a datafile with your iD, and you\ncan grant permission directly.
      See [more on the ORCID\nInbox](https://support.orcid.org/hc/en-us/articles/360006972953).\n\n####
      Q. Will Crossref and DataCite be able to update my ORCID record with already
      published works for which I did not use my ORCID iD?\n\nNo. The auto-update
      process only applies to those works that these\norganizations receive that include
      your ORCID iD. For previous works\nthat did not include your ORCID iD, you will
      need to use the DataCite\nand Crossref Search and Link wizards to connect information
      with your\niD.\n\n#### Q. What information will be posted to my record?\n\nWith
      your permission, basic information about the article (such as\ntitle, list of
      contributors, journal, or publisher) or dataset (such as\ndata center name and
      date of publication) will be posted, along with a\nDOI that allows users to
      navigate to the source paper or dataset landing\npage.\n\n#### Q. What if my
      journal or data center doesn''t collect ORCID iDs? {#q-what-if-my-journal-or-data-center-doesn%E2%80%99t-collect-orcid-ids}\n\nAsk
      them too! This simple step can be accomplished using either the\nPublic or Member
      ORCID APIs. Information about integrating ORCID iDs in\n[publishing](http://members.orcid.org/publisher-workflow)
      and\n[repository](http://members.orcid.org/repository-systems) workflows is\npublicly
      available.\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nThis blog post was [originally\npublished](https://doi.org/10.5438/ferw-cwhq)
