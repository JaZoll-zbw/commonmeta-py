      supporting member of ResearchEquals,\nsustaining and governing the development
      of modular publishing.\n\nAs part of their commitment to Open Science, KU Leuven
      supports\nsustainable implementations of Open Access and Open Science through
      the\n[KU Leuven Fund for Fair\nOA](https://www.kuleuven.be/open-science/what-is-open-science/scholarly-publishing-and-open-access/open-access-kuleuven/OS-services?ref=libscie.org).\nThe
      fund is usually only available to non-profits, but ResearchEquals''\ngovernance
      convinced KU Leuven to support a for-profit initiative.\n\n\"We don''t want
      to be too rigid in our approach and understand that\npublishing or other research
      infrastructures can work according to\ndifferent sustainability models. What
      matters to us is that, if profits\nare made, they are reinvested in the academic
      community and that\nresearchers remain firmly in control.\" Demmy Verbeke said.\n\nSupporting
      members help sustain operations and receive additional\ngovernance rights for\n[ResearchEquals](https://researchequals.com/?ref=libscie.org).
      These\nrights include the option to participate in quarterly assemblies,\nstrategy
      and decision making processes, the power to block acquisitions,\nand to request
      more information around business operations. As a result,\nsupporting members
      shape how ResearchEquals evolves. Individuals can\nbecome supporting members
      for 79.99 euro''s per year. Institutions can\nbecome supporting members for
      a yearly contribution of at least 2500\neuro''s.\n\nResearchEquals is an open
      source, open access publishing platform for\nresearch modules. ResearchEquals
      realized the first modular publishing\nplatform (launched February 1st, 2022),
      which revolves around sharing\nthe research process, step by step, instead of
      only the final report.\n\n\"It is great to see KU Leuven support generative
      projects, regardless of\nwhether they are for-profit or not\" Chris Hartgerink
      said.\n\nKU Leuven is one of the first institutional supporting members of\nResearchEquals.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKU
      Leuven is one of the largest universities in Belgium, with a strong\ncommitment
