      THOR partners have recently integrated [ORCID](http://orcid.org/) in\ntheir
      disciplinary data repositories. This post describes ORCID\nintegration in [PANGAEA](https://www.pangaea.de/),
      the Data Publisher\nfor Earth & Environmental Science.]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n\n[PANGAEA
      is rolling out a new version of its website. Developers and\ndesigners are currently
      ironing out a few remaining open issues. The\nrelease is expected for autumn
      2016. Among major improvements in search,\ndesign, and usability, a key new
      feature is the integration of\nORCID.]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n\n[The new
      feature enables existing PANGAEA users to connect their PANGAEA\nprofile with
      their ORCID iD, as demonstrated in the video\nbelow.\u00a0]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n\n[]{.embed-youtube
      style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"}\n\n[With this connection, PANGAEA
      obtains the\n]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}*[validated]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}*[\nORCID
      iD of its users from ORCID. By connecting their ORCID iD, users\ncan also choose
      to sign in to PANGAEA using ORCID, as an alternative to\nsigning in using PANGAEA
      user credentials. This can be handy when a user\nis already signed in to ORCID,
      or it is quicker to recall ORCID\ncredentials.]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n\n[Obtaining
      the validated ORCID iDs of its users is significant for\nPANGAEA as, contrary
      to a researcher''s name, the iD is unambiguous: two\nresearchers with the same
      name can be distinguished by their respective\niDs. The iD is also persistent
      through possible changes in a person''s\nname: the same researcher may change
      marital status, or their name may\nappear in different permutations, at times
      appear with full name,\ninitials for first name, and with or without middle
      name (initial).\nFurthermore, the iD is actionable and can be used to discover\ninformation
      about the researcher.]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n\n[For researchers, the
      greatest advantage of connecting their ORCID iD to\ntheir PANGAEA profile is
      that PANGAEA can then record the relationships\nbetween dataset publication
      DOIs and contributor ORCID iDs. This\ninformation is then shared with the global
      network of PID\ninfrastructures, and researchers benefit from automated updates
      to their\nORCID Record for data published at PANGAEA, gaining unambiguous\nattribution
      for published datasets and benefiting from greater credit\nfor sharing data
      early.]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n\n[Let''s take a look at how the ORCID
      integration in PANGAEA is making a\ndifference to [Dr Alice\nLefebvre](https://www.marum.de/en/Alice_Lefebvre.html),\n[GLOMAR](https://www.marum.de/en/GLOMAR.html)
      Associate Scientist at the\n[MARUM](https://www.marum.de/en/index.html) Center
      for Marine\nEnvironmental Sciences of the [University of\nBremen](http://www.uni-bremen.de/en.html).
      ]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n\n[Alice has recently joined ORCID and decided
      to claim the 14 data\npublications deposited at PANGAEA that she has authored.
      As a\nconsequence, Alice gains a more complete [ORCID\nRecord](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9234-8279),
      one that does not just\ninclude her journal article publications but also her
      authorship in data\npublications ]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}[\u2212]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}[
      a\nrecord that better reflects her true contribution to the scientific\nrecord.
      Alice was also surprised to learn about\n[DataCite](http://datacite.org) and
      the\n[overview](http://search.datacite.org/contributors/0000-0002-9234-8279)\nDataCite
      provides about her contributions. ]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n\n[The upcoming
      release of the PANGAEA website automates the sharing of\ninformation with the
      global network of PID infrastructures. Authors of\ndatasets published at PANGAEA
      who have connected their ORCID iD, like\nAlice, will benefit from a workflow
      that ensures information appears\nautomatically and accurately on their ORCID\nRecord.]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n\n[This
      shows how far the integration between disciplinary repositories\nand the global
      network of PID infrastructures has come over the past\nyears, and how the persistent
      identification of contributors and\nresearch artefacts together with infrastructures
      that aggregate,\nprocess, and share information about persistently identified
      resources\nare driving and shaping 21st-century attribution, credit, communication,\nand
      measurement of scholarly activity.]{style=\"font-weight:400;\"}\n\n**Want to
